      Your Telegram account may get banned.
      I am not responsible for any improper use of this bot
      This bot is intended for the purpose of having fun with memes,
      as well as efficiently managing groups.
      You ended up spamming groups, getting reported left and right,
      and you ended up in a Finale Battle with Telegram and at the end
      Telegram Team deleted your account?
      And after that, then you pointed your fingers at us
      for getting your acoount deleted?
      I will be rolling on the floor laughing at you.

<p align="left"><a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/PrajjuS/ProjectFizilion/tree/demon"> <img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Heroku" /></a></p>


### Deploy Locally (Linux, macOS, and Android [via Termux])
1. Clone this repository on your local machine and `cd` (or `chdir`, anti bloat guy) to it
2. Set up Python virtual environment named "venv" inside it (Requires `virtualenv` installed on the system)
  - `virtualenv venv`
  - Don't forget to activate the virtualenv: `. venv/bin/activate`
3. Set up database for the userbot, search Google on how to set up a local database (PostgreSQL is recommended)
4. Install the requirements: `pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt`
5. Edit `sample_config.env` and save it as `config.env`
  - Do not forget to fill in the `REQUIRED %%` values, or else the bot will not run
6. Run the bot: `bash ./run.sh`
  - Protip: See what `bash ./run.sh --help` tells you
